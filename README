pas-gpib -- Full measurement framework for GPIB, USB-TMC, TCP/IP, ...
=====================================================================

**pas-gpib** is a full framework to perform measurements with professional
instruments controlled via GPIB, USB-TMC, TCP/IP, RS-232, ...

The framework is written in Pascal using `FreePascal
<http://www.freepascal.org/>`_. It has a Pascal header translations for
Linux GPIB including an object-oriented wrapper. A USB Test and Measurement
class implementation is included.

Although this is work in progress, several protocols and instrumets are fully
supported.


Design Principle
================

This package is organized into two major parts
 - instruments
 - device communicators

For each **instrument** (e.g., multimeter, scope, spectrum analyzer, ...) a
dedicated class is implemented, which derives from ``TRemoteInstrument``. These
use a **device communicator** instance, which is a class which implements the
``IDeviceCommunicator`` interface.

See ``doc/UML.dia`` for an UML class diagram.

The ``TRemoteInstrument`` class holds an instance of an ``IDeviceCommunicator``
class. Therefore, to create an instrument object (e.g., ``TLeCroyWaveJet``,
which is derived from ``TRemoteInstrument``), you have to supply an instance
of a class implementing ``IDeviceCommunicator``, e.g.,
``TTCPLeCroyCommunicator``.


Device Communicators
====================

Currently, there are five device communicator classes
 - ``TUSBTMCCommunicator``
 - ``TUSBLeCroyCommunicator``
 - ``TRS232Communicator``
 - ``TTCPCommunicator``
 - ``TTCPLeCroyCommunicator``
 - ``TGPIBCommunicator``

These are implemented in Pascal units in ``devcom/``.

The ``TUSBTMCCommunicator`` provides communication to instruments with a
USB Test and Measurement Class (USB-TMC) interface [USBTMC10]_. It uses
``TUSBTMCUSB488``, which implements the USB-TMC USB488 Subclass [USB488]_ to
provide IEEE-488 (GPIB) communication via USB. ``TUSBTMCUSB488`` is derived
from ``TUSBTMCBase``, which implements the base USB-TMC communication. These
classes are implemented in units in ``usb/``.

.. [USBTMC10] Universal Serial Bus Test and Measurement Class Specification
   (USBTMC), Revision 1.0, April 14, 2003

.. [USB488] Universal Serial Bus Test and Measurement Class, Subclass USB488
   Specification (USBTMC-USB488), Revision 1.0, April 14, 2003

The ``TUSBLeCroyCommunicator`` provides communication with LeCroy scopes which
do not adhere to the USB-TMC specification. These include the WaveAce and
WaveJet devices. It uses a `` TUSBLeCroy``, which implements a driver for the
proprietary protocol. This was reverse engineered with the Windows "virtual COM
port" driver.

The ``TGPIBCommunicator`` provides communication to instruments with an
IEEE-488 (GPIB) interface. It uses ``TGPIB``, an object oriented wrapper for
`Linux GPIB <http://linux-gpib.sourceforge.net/>`_. These are implemented in
units in ``gpib/``.

The class ``TTCPCommunicator`` provides basic TCP/IP communication to a host
at a given TCP port. The descendant class ``TTCPLeCroyCommunicator`` adds a
special header used by several LeCroy scopes when communicating via TCP/IP.
Their protocol was reverse-engineered.


Instruments
===========

Currently, rudimentary support for three devices is available
 - ``TLeCroyWaveJet`` for LeCroy WaveJet scopes
 - ``TKeithley2010`` for Keithley 2010 multimeters
 - ``TRohdeSchwarzFSEB`` for Rohde&Schwarz FSEB spectrum analyzers
 - ``TAgilent34410A`` for Agilent 34410A digital multimeters
 - ``TKeithley2600`` for Keithley 2602A SourceMeter SMU Instruments


Verified
========

 - ``testusbtmc`` correctly lists (at least one) USB-TMC capable device and
   performs "``*IDN?``".
 - ``testagilent34410a`` correctly communicates via USB-TMC as well as TCP with
   the device and performs a test measurement.
 - ``testlecroywavejet3xx`` correctly communicates via TCP as well as USB with
   the device, performs settings and saves a screenshot. 
 - ``testkeithley2600`` correctly communicates via TCP with the device and
   performs settings and measurements.

TODO
====

 - FSEB: search manual, add functions and stuff to build test program
 - document how to get Linux-GPIB in Debian (with direct SVN checkout or so)
 - add lots of devices
    - Agilent E3631A Power Supply
    - Agilent 33220A Arbitrary Waveform Generator
 - add many functions to devices, always specify reference manual
 - add test programs
    - Rohde&Schwarz FSEB to get the nice image with satellite spectrum
    - Keithley 2010 with the switcher card to demonstrate the settling time
      (and add a comment on this example to TKeithley2010.SelectChannel)
 - dedicated section in this README about the test programs
 - TKeithely2010:
    - generalize to 2000
    - select DCV/ACV/DCI/ACI/Ohm2/Ohm4/Freq/Temp, many more functions
 - TKeithley2600:
    - add methods PrintBuffer and PrintNumber, care for "Trim" in Query()!
    - add method SetDataFormat which sets  "format.data = ..." and stores this
      information for later use by PrintBuffer and PrintNumber; but hide
      "format.byteorder" and always set it to what is easiest for the local
      machine; or include this with SetDataFormat
    - flexible buffer handling (MakeBuffer, ...)
 - add communicator for LXI (LAN eXtensions for Instrumentation)
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAN_eXtensions_for_Instrumentation
   mDNS/DNS-SD, SCPI Port (Telnet?)
 - finish implementation of USB488, carefully read the spec
 - License: use modified LGPL, the individual instrument drivers only have a
   few basic functions, actively encourage users of pas-gpib to contribute their
   added methods (which is required by the license, except they derive from the
   class) and their added instruments
